books:
 - title: Tomorrow In The Battle Think On Me
   author: Javier Marias
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307950751 
   date_finished: 2/17/2019
   notes: Abandoned. I think somewhere in this book is buried a wonderful treasure. The looping self-aware story is fundamentally interesting and new but the language that wraps around it chokes it to death. Abandoned about half way through :(
 - title: Summerland
   author: Hannu Rajaniemi
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756K1Q8D/
   date_finished: 1/21/2019
   notes: A wonderful original work - full of interesting characters. Ghosts! Spys! Old London! Really enjoyed this and tore through it super fast.
 - title: Finite & Infinite Games
   author: James Carse
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004W3FM4A/
   date_finished: 1/10/2019
   notes: Great unique book, wonderful analogy to finite and infinite writing....
 - title: The Power
   author: Naomi Alderman
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0Z1EY0
   date_finished: 12/30/2018
   notes: Provocative premise but I felt it squandered an opportunity at a deeper political and/or emotional exploration of what would happen if teenage girls gained a new incredible power. Somehow it resorted to.... fucking and fighting?
 - title: Perdido Street Station
   author: China Mieville
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FBFO8C/
   date_finished: 12/01/2018
   notes: A staggering, creative, filthy, engrossing tour through a world with such magical and rich depths. No one can build worlds like China.
 - title: Satin Island
   author: Tom McCarthy
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZWA678/
   date_finished: 03/21/2018
   notes: William Gibson meets Kafka. A corporate strategy consultant / ethnographer ponders the meaning of life and searches for the Great Report.
 - title: The Dark Dark
   author: Samantha Hunt
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0TDSVM/
   date_finished: 02/15/2018
   notes: Tender, oozing, lyrical, dark, DARK stories of being human. Did I mention they are dark? What writing though! What imagination!
