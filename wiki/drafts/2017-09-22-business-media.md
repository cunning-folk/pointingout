The other day Dan Frommer, Editor in Chief of Recode, tweeted out this:

I've been thinking a lot about this problem recently. I work with a lot of companies helping them with this exact question and then today Quartz at Work launched and I thought - ok time to blog!.

So here are some notes and thought starters for the question of what a "modern business publication" should be and do:

# A View from Nowhere

What's your point of view? I think this is an essential question

# Branding

Branding!
You can't get to the about page. What even IS the about page?
How do you instantly recognize a recode URL in your feed?
Branding is friction and content is about removing friction.


A point of view. You're not news.
What is your point of view on AI?
Kara's POV is strong
Quartzy?
NYT 2020 report on mission/vision

Promote the voices of the individuals.

The podcast is great. The newsletter is great. Promote them with real CTAs

Bullets and real digests

Hero content. What are you *known* for? Data viz in service of big hitting items.
Mary Meeker is top shared content on your site. Maybe readers want deep content?

Understand your audience
Insights = better ads
Why are ads on recode just generic vox ads?

Gather your audience
Yes, you have the conference. But it's pretty exclusive.
What's the identity moment for non-code attendees that like recode?
Schwag? Community? Facebook group? Slack channel?

# Maybe ditch the ads?
