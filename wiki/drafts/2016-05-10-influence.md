In summary - here's a step by step guide to getting more influence and buy-in at work:

1) Treat your boss like a coach not a judge
2) Realize that your ideas are probably bad
3) Remember there is no "just"
4) If it's a good idea, prove it.
5) Pitch big but start small
6) Figure out a creative way to distribute content internally (video, printed material, internal blog etc)
7) Use that contnet platform to get buy in but also to join the dots between the small experiments and te big ideas
