I don't know why it was so surprising when I read it. But when I saw the headline I suddenly realized all at once that we're in a new era.

"[How The New York Times plans new subscription products](https://digiday.com/media/new-york-times-plans-new-subscription-products/)"

Maybe?
Why hasn't it happend yet?

Subscriptions - more broadly publishers having to figure out how to do real product development (link to NYT devlops new products)

Future of games is content - see how often fortnite publishes new content.

So - is the future of media organizations games?
