I have availability for new clients for the firs time in about 18 months and I've been reflecting.

Yes, I made a workshops page. Does it accurately capture the work I do? No. Of course not. How could it?

What use is content without a distribution engine behind it?

How to do "authentic" marketing?

How to build a marketing machine that doesn't make me feel grimy.

So I'm contemplating building a media brand - not a consulting brand. But to sell consulting! Why else? I need to eat.
