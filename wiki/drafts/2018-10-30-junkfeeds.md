Rem Koolhaas laid out the foundations of modern space in his essay Junkspace. But as we tipple over into the eve of 2020 it's time to acknowledge that Junkspace has been colonized by Junkfeeds. As our experience of space increasingly overlaps with digital space our physical environments are prone to viruses and hacking. And junkfeeds have fully and successfully hacked our physical environment.

The human neck has been slumped by junkfeeds. In every space. At every point in time.

Junkfeeds started as an authentic human space of sharing - here are things to be interested in, excited about, important things, small things. This notion was quickly gutted. Facebook removed organic audiences from you unless you pay, Facebook and Twitter revealed the algorithmic timeline.

But the feeds accelerated and became industrialized two things happened.

Below the surface of junkfeeds algorithms shape the content to normalize and sanitize it. Like the underbelly of workers at the hotel you stay at. Invisible infrastructure to ensure minimum viable sanitation. Removing any content that is an outlier.

And Google eventually, bigger than twitter, has removed humans entirely (and next perhaps is going to be the human-written content underneath)

Junkfeeds are slot machines. Gambling with our attention and emotional response. We used to "play" the slots by dragging to refresh, but the feeds now infinite and real time no longer require refreshing. Now, we "play" by interacting with the feed. Hearting, thumbsing, commenting, (and not very often) clicking. But every click in the junkfeed spawns more feed. A fractal reward for playing the junkfeed.

The subtle soothing reassuring voice of Instagram saying "you're all caught up" sits in stark contrast to the reality of a 4-dimensional infinity of infinite feeds within the app. The "feed", stories, activity feed, "search". Search function is the unregulated feed of our basest emotions sidestepping any notion of people you know and mmoving straight to third base with sex, abs, comedy, guns, politics, travel. It's a funhouse mirror of our own desires reflected back to us in an infinite feed.






Junkfeeds colonise junkspace

Sections:

User generated to computer generated

Infinite feeds

Spawning-fractal feeds (click on a link and generate more)

Political feeds - dismembering politics

Disenfranchising - youthfeeds, from junkfood to junkfeeds

Everywhere is junkspace now. Everytime is junkfeeds. Junktime.


Americans spend quiet time in their car. Staring at their phone. At their junkfeeds.

An excellent version of the essay Junkspace appears here rendered in a beautiful digtial version by Caavia here: https://www.cavvia.net/junkspace/ and is a perfect digital companion to this essay.


Junkfeeds. (posted on junkfeeds.com ?)

Thesis: industrialized and algorithmic feeds have sucked the "feed" dry. But there is value in subscribing to flows if we can learn to put the junkfeeds in their place and build smaller personal flows. We'll do that via 


The algorithmic feed is designed (for whom? by whom?) to deliver us "better" content.

Practical tips:

Remove algorithmic timelines
Nurture small feeds


Everywhere is junkspace now. Everytime is junkfeeds. Junktime.

Junkfeeds - click a link and it spawns a fractal of new variations for you. For YOU.

"Junkspace is post-existential; it makes you uncertain where you are, obscures where you go, undoes where you were."

"Junkspace is often described as a space of flows, but that is a misnomer; flows depend on disciplined movement, bodies that cohere. Junkspace is a web without spider; although it is an architecture of the masses, each trajectory is strictly unique."

"search" function within FB/Twitter has become an infinite feed of pre-searches. Pre-crimes. Filled with the basest desires.

Same for youtube.

"Junkspace pretends to unite, but it actually splinters. It creates communities not of shared interest or free association, but of identical statistics and unavoidable demographics, an oportunistic weave of vested interests. Each man, woman and child is individually targeted, tracked, split off from the rest.. Fragments come together at 'security' only, where a grid of video screens disappointingly reassembles individual frames into a banalized, utilitarian cubism that reveals junkspace's overall coherence to the dispassionate glare of barely trained guards: videoethnography in its brute form. "

"The 21st century will bring 'intelligent' Junkspace: on a big digital 'dashboard': sales, CNNNYSENASDAQC-SPAN, anything that goes up or down, from good to bad, presented in real time like the automotive theory course that complements driving lessons..."

"Conceptually, each monitor, each TV screen is a substitute for a window; real life is inside, cyberspace has become the great outdoors..."
