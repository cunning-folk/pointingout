here's a fun blog post for you, me, us, someone to write
I clicked on this - http://newnatures.org/greenhouse/events/cfp-in-the-clouds-workshop/ which is talking about about clouds
and thought of the idea of a "personal cloud" 
i.e. personal data cloud
or processing cloud
and then I realized there's actually a few different mental models for the future of augmented computing - centaurs, personal daemons, personal cloud, serviceworkers and probably more
would be fun to unpack which of those models is most likely to catch on and why
