Ship's log?

Reference berg week notes.
THe best business blogs are not "how to" but rather "week 145 in deep space"

Most business books are nothing more than the hero’s journey dressed up in a pinstripe suit (or hoodie if you’re talking startup business books).

They’re vapid, not relevant and barely useful.

I’d much rather make a book that’s a boat journey - businesses do go on quests but often very boring ones with complicated resolution (if at all). And the ship becomes a home for some people who have to navigate life within it.

There’s two trends I want to cover:

Deep sea fishing (i.e. small teams with disproportionate income that leads to the rise of free agents and fuzzy business boundaries)
