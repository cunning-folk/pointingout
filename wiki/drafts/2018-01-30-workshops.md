Workshops work. 

They're efficient. In the sense that they're expensive but short and you get to the heart of issues quickly.

Sparring.



It's good for them and good for me.

Provocation - can you get them to think differently about their business?

Easiest way I know to sell strategic work is to get them to trust you and see that you have knowledge and experience across multiple parts of the business (management, brand, marketing, product etc)

I think most workshops are overly scripted. I've seen too many workshops optimized for people to have a good time instead of to reach insights or new ideas.
