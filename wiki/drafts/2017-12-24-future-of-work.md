The second half of this podcast: https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/02/venkatesh-rao-decision-making/ is truly original in the thinking of the changing face of the corporation and how it will impact the world of work for everyone.

If 200 people can build a 1B company then what are the rest of us doing? And how do we profit from the orbit of that company?

My friend who is early user of pinterest leverages that network into photography and pinning biz.

Think of the orbits of the billion dollar startup:
Agencies (social media, SEO, security devops)
Consultants (legal advice, sales, partnerships, marketing)
Freelancers (influencer marketing, HR, branding)
Power users (early adopters)

The idea that middle managers were the defining force of business in the last 50 years. But next, the defining force is going to be the free agent.
