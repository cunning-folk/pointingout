Some personal wikis and sites that I've been inspired by:

[buster.wiki/](https://buster.wiki/) - Strong design and everything has a date by the looks of it which enables an RSS feed. Very polished and thought through.

[are.na](https://are.na) - A platform that all the cool kids use for building personal knowledge libraries. Lightly social, perhaps the right answer but slightly questionable if they'll be around for a long time. Ymmv.

[Brendan's /canon](https://www.brendanschlagel.com/2017/11/05/canonize-creating-personal-canon-template/) - this was part of the original inspiration for me. A curated list of pure stock - things that Brendan returns to again and again. He has a template you can copy too.

[Worrydream's quotes page](http://worrydream.com/#!/quotes) - just a massive list of interesting quotes collected by Brett Victor. Notice how being one giant page makes it instantly searchable.

[daywreckers.com](http://daywreckers.com/) - from Ben Pieratt, not quite a wiki but a very minimal site designed to collect the dots. A daily visit from me.

[derek sivers' daily journal](https://sivers.org/dj) - a post from Derek Sivers on how to keep a text-file long-term store for your ideas and notes.

And there's lots more too - [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1083823277712248832) has a whole bunch of interesting rabbit holes.
